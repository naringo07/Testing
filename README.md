---------------------------------------

The DroneB project is meant to act as a starting point for Tello Drone programming in the Intro to Programming course at Principia College.

## Files Included
There are several python files available for use:

- DroneBLib.py - A library module that can be included in your python project to expose the DroneB functionality to your own program.  This includes to sample files:

    - BasicB.py - Shows how to use the DroneBlib.py in a minimalistic way.

    - AdvB.py - a more advanced way to use DroneBlib.py.  Be sure to read the comments in the AdvB.py file to see how to use it.

    - DBQR.py - another advanced pythong script that displays the text of a QR code when read.

- QR.py - a library to read QR files

## Installation
To use this library, you must include the following with the pip3 command:

- opencv-python
- tellopy
- av
- numpy
- pygame
- image

Install these libraries with the command:

    pip3 install <library>

ie:

    pip3 install opencv-python

## Execution Demo Programs
Execute the programs with the following:

    python <script>

ie

    python ./BasicB.py

## Using Libraries Yourself
Place the DroneBLib.py file into your project and include the module in 
your python script.  Finally, create a DroneB object 
to control the drone:

    from DroneBLib import DroneB

    def main():
        db = DroneB()
        db.start()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

## Drone Controls
Out of the box, the following key controls are available for operating the drone.

Tab - lift off
WASD - Drone Forward, Left, Right, Back
Q/E - slow yaw
Arrow keys - ascend, descend, or yaw
H - toggle HUD
Backspace - land
P - palm-land
Enter - take picture
R - toggle recording
C - toggle command queue on/off
X - toggle forward / downward cam (Only on edu model drone)
